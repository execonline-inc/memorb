- test child memoization integration support where the child class can override parent method to have it memoized
- modules should be able to define methods that can be included into a class that implements memorb
- duplicate integration inclusions should be allowed if they add instances to be cached
- implementers should be able to pass options to the inclusion
- make stores thread-safe (consider using a read-write lock implementation)
- create a top-level method that works as a multi-tool
  #   Memorb(IntegratingKlass)  #=> returns mixin for given class
  #   Memorb(:method1, :method2)  #=> returns mixin for given methods
  #   Memorb(method: :memorb_is_awesome!)  #=> returns mixin with option of different method name
