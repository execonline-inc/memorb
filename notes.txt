todo
- should never auto memorize methods upon inclusion (implementer should always be explicit)
- anonymous mixin should respect the explicitly passed methods (it currently doesn't)
- specs between implementations should not have code duplication (look into RSpec solution)
- the custom `Memorb(Implementation)` module should always be prepended to the implementing class
- avoid alias_method_chain approach to overriding implementer instance methods
